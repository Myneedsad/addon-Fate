ðŸ“œ About Licenses
A license explains how other people can use, modify, share, or contribute to your code. It protects both the developer (you) and the users by clearly stating the rules of usage.

Why include a license?
Without a license:

Others legally cannot reuse, copy, or distribute your code.

Your project becomes "all rights reserved" by default â€” even if itâ€™s open-source.

Collaborators or communities may hesitate to contribute.

Common open-source licenses:
License	Permissions	Notes
MIT	âœ… Use, copy, modify, distribute	Very permissive. Often used in JavaScript/TS projects.
Apache 2.0	âœ… Same as MIT + patent rights	Slightly more protective.
GPL v3	âœ… Use, but must share changes under same license	"Copyleft" â€” any derivative work must also be open-source.
Unlicense	âœ… No restrictions	Public domain dedication.

âœ… Recommended License: MIT License
For most small tools, add-ons, and learning projects like this one, MIT License is often the best fit because it's short, permissive, and widely used
